# Transpile AI Website

### Dev Environment:

1. Install node.js

2. `npm install` to install the necessary packages

3. `npm start` to run the website on localhost

### Deployment:

- To deploy the app to GitHub pages, run `npm run deploy`

- This makes an automatic build commit to the `gh-pages` branch of this repo

- NOTE: this can cause the website to be down for some time while it's updating

- If the website isn't deploying to `transpile-ai.com`, check that the CNAME file is in the root directory on the `gh-pages` branch
